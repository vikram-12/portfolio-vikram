## Portfolio
This is my portfolio web app made using React and Strapi CMS. For all sections I have created schemas in Strapi and fields of various types according to the sections are added .
The UI is made dynamic for all these sections , due to which using Strapi(the deployed production version) we can add, update or delete data and changes reflect in the UI without changing code in frontend.
The user friendly interface of Strapi allows user do changes easily with no-code.
